# Fantasy Wars
Fantasy Wars is a turn-based strategy game where each players can choose one of three mythical factions. Build up an army, capture strategic footholds, and slaughter opposing forces on your way to victory. Eliminate all enemy units or capture their castle to ensure victory.

# Basic Rules (Units):
Units are the forces in your army that you control to try and win the battle. Units fall into one of four categories: Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery, and Flying.

# Gameplay (Player Turn)
A player can move each unit once per turn, one at a time. When a player selects a unit to move, the squares it is allowed to move to are highlighted. A player selects a highlighted square to move a unit to that square. After moving (or not moving) if any enemies are within range, a unit can attack that enemy. Though some units can not move and attack in the same turn. When a unit engages another unit, first the unit that did the engaging attacks, then the other unit may counter attack if the unit is adjacent and has a min range of 1.

# Basic Rules (Terrain):
There are different kinds of terrain that units can traverse. Terrain can hinder movement, protect from range attacks, and some can be captured to gain an advantage. Some terrain can be captured and used to either gain resources, or spend resources to create units. If the structure belongs to you and a unit starts the turn on it, it will gain 20% of its max health and restore all ammo. Only infantry units can capture buildings.
